# App Policies and Legal Documents for Apps by Kaushik Rajan

Welcome! This repository serves as the central, publicly accessible location for important legal and policy documents related to the iOS applications developed by Kaushik Rajan.

## Purpose of This Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to provide transparent, reliable, and easily accessible hosting for documents such as:

1.  **Privacy Policies:** Detailing how user data (if any) is handled within each application.
2.  **Terms of Service / EULA:** (Optional) Outlining the terms users agree to when using the apps.
3.  **Support Information:** (Optional) Centralizing links or information related to customer support.

I use GitHub Pages for hosting these documents because it allows:

* **Stable Public Links:** Providing the necessary URLs required by the Apple App Store.
* **Version Control:** All changes to these documents are tracked using Git. This means you can view the history of updates for full transparency.
* **Centralized Management:** Keeping all policies organized in one place for easier maintenance and user access.
* **Free Hosting:** GitHub Pages provides free hosting for these static documents.

## Repository Structure

Documents are organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific application. Inside each app's folder, you will typically find:

* `privacy.md`: The Privacy Policy specific to that application.
* `support.md`: Support information and contact details for that application.
* `terms.md`: (If applicable) The Terms of Service or End User License Agreement for that application.

## How to Access These Documents

To find the policy relevant to a specific application:

1. For privacy policies: `https://kvr06-ai.github.io/support-documents/[app-name]/privacy`

3. For terms of service (if available): `https://kvr06-ai.github.io/support-documents/[app-name]/terms`

Direct links to the relevant policies are also provided within each application's settings/about screen and on its respective App Store product page.

## Policy Updates & Transparency

We are committed to transparency regarding our policies.

* **Version History:** All modifications, updates, or corrections to these documents are tracked via Git commits. You can view the commit history for any file on GitHub to see what changed and when.
* **Review:** Policies are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary to reflect changes in app functionality, regulations, or for clarity. The "Last reviewed" date noted below indicates the most recent overall check, though individual documents may be updated more frequently.
