# App Policies and Legal Documents for Apps by Kaushik Rajan

Welcome! This repository serves as the central, publicly accessible location for important legal and policy documents related to the iOS applications developed by Kaushik Rajan.

## Purpose of This Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to provide transparent, reliable, and easily accessible hosting for documents such as:

1.  **Privacy Policies:** Detailing how user data (if any) is handled within each application.
2.  **Terms of Service / EULA:** (Optional) Outlining the terms users agree to when using the apps.
3.  **Support Information:** (Optional) Centralizing links or information related to customer support.

I use GitHub for hosting these documents because it allows:

* **Stable Public Links:** Providing the necessary URLs required by the Apple App Store.
* **Version Control:** All changes to these documents are tracked using Git. This means you can view the history of updates for full transparency.
* **Centralized Management:** Keeping all policies organized in one place for easier maintenance and user access.

## Repository Structure

Documents are organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific application. Inside each app's folder, you will typically find:

* `privacy.md`: The Privacy Policy specific to that application.
* `terms.md`: (If applicable) The Terms of Service or End User License Agreement for that application.


## How to Find Your Policy

To find the policy relevant to a specific application you use:

1.  Identify the name of the app (e.g., `[App Name 1]`).
2.  Navigate into the folder with that exact name within this repository.
3.  Click on the `privacy.md` file (or `terms.md`, etc.) to view its content.

Direct links to the relevant policies are also provided within each application's settings/about screen and on its respective App Store product page.

## Policy Updates & Transparency

We are committed to transparency regarding our policies.

* **Version History:** All modifications, updates, or corrections to these documents are tracked via Git commits. You can view the commit history for any file on GitHub to see what changed and when.
* **Review:** Policies are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary to reflect changes in app functionality, regulations, or for clarity. The "Last reviewed" date noted below indicates the most recent overall check, though individual documents may be updated more frequently.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about these policies or how they apply to a specific app, please do not hesitate to contact me via email:**fs.kvr06@gmail.com**

I aim to respond to all policy-related inquiries promptly.
